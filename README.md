# Python-Kivy-Calculator App
 
This is a calculator app I built while learning how to build a mobile application completely from scratch using python. I used the kivy module to create the app. The purpose of this project is to create a calculator in python while create amazing cross platform mobile applications for both android & iOS devices. The goal of this project is to learn and showcase the versatilty of coding in python. To better showchase the project, I converted the python script to a EXE file enabling the user to have a smoother and faster experience rather than the apk app. 


## What I Learned/Project Covers

```
- Python App development

```
